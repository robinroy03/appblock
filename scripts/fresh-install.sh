# install the freshly built APK.

# Android's Auto Backup (on by default for every app) copies AppBlock's data
# to the phone's Google account and restores it when the app is installed
# again, which would bring the old rules straight back. So restore-on-install
# is switched off for this one install, and always switched back on after.
